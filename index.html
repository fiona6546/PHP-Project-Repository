				There are many different types of trails, but our website focuses on swing trails, cave trails, and wildflower trails!
				<details>
					<br> 1. <a href="file:///M:/Portfolio%20Swing%20Trails/index.html">Swing Trails</a>- Swing trails are trails that have swings suspended from trees at every rest area. After one finishes hiking
					a mile, for example, they might come across a tire swing suspended from a tree!
					</br>
					<br> 2. <a href="file:///M:/sidrahs%20cave%20trail%20code/index.html">Cave Trails</a>-Cave Trails are usually found near large monuments with big mountains. They go inside the caves found in the mountains.
					</br>
					<br> 3. <a href="file:///M:/PHP%20Website%20Project/PHP-Project-Repository/index.html">Wildflower Trails</a>- Wildflower trails are trails that have breathtaking views of fields of wildflowers. The vivid colors and gorgeous sky 
					make for a wonderful picnic setting.
